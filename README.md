# rjxs exercises

This application contains unit tests. These tests are currently failing. 
The services need to be fixed - do not modify the unit tests.

* Fix `todo.service`
* Fix `user.service`
* Fix `dashboard.service`

Hint: The first two are easy, the dashboard is challenging 
(and is not meant at all for developers who are new to RxJs).

However, the dashboard exercise doesn't have to be completed in
one go: there are multiple steps and different implementation
paths that you can follow. If you want more guidance, then
check [Guidance.md](./Guidance.md).
